    begin_release_notes

1.2.10.1235 (2018-07-05)
========================

Features
--------

- Add the Billing module, which provides access to the account's financial
  configurations. (#1210)


1.2.9.1210 (2018-06-27)
=======================

Features
--------

- Remove custom properties from accounts and user entities. (#1362)

- Documentation now includes a full API reference, generated from the source
  code. (#1407)

Bugfixes
--------

- Minor adjustments to TPIP reporting. (#1346)

- Previously, notifications for resource value changes would not be triggered.
  Resource value change subscriptions now use the correct routing keys. The SDK
  now provides the expected values for `device_id` and `resource_path` when
  notifying user code. (#1361)


1.2.8.1183 (2018-06-11)
=======================

Features
--------
- Support List Pre Shared Keys endpoint for Bootstrap API (#631)

- `News` renamed to `Changelog` (#1278)

- PaginatedResponse objects used in API list endpoints now takes `max_results`
  and `page_size` to remove the ambiguity of the `limit` parameter. (#1296)

- Resources channel now receives the full notification rather than just the
  payload. (#1318)

Bugfixes
--------

- Log messages no longer go directly to the root logger (#1091)

- If autostart is disabled, a CloudException is no longer raised when there is
  no long-polling thread (e.g. for the get_resource_value method). This fixes a
  regression that stopped Webhooks from being cleanly enabled. (#1292)


1.2.8.970 (2018-05-22)
======================

Features
--------

- Third Party IP reports are generated according to a common format. (#1008)

- New dockerised CI build system (#1037)

- Client-Lite: Add device bootstrap API. This provides the ability to set
  Pre-Shared Keys for device bring-up. (#1099)

- Adds 'Value Change' subscription channel. This supercedes 'presubscription'
  and 'subscription' behaviours to provide a uniform interface, in line with
  the existing 'Device State' channel. (#1102)

- Add new 'in' and 'not in (nin)' filter operators to enable that functionality
  in the IAM api. (#1225)

- Client-Lite: Manifest upload supports upload of keytable file (#552)

- First to Claim: If a certificate is in enrollment mode, signature is not
  required (#924)

- Configuration can be set using environment variables `MBED_CLOUD_SDK_HOST`
  and `MBED_CLOUD_SDK_API_KEY` (m0)

- All pull requests against the repository should have a news file describing
  the benefit of the work done. (m1)

Bugfixes
--------

- Reduce the number of logs that go directly to the root logger (#1091)

- Online documentation now links back to GitHub for license and contribution
  guidelines (#1097)

- Link to the new location of the online documentation (#1109)


1.2.7.968 (2018-03-27)
======================

Features
--------

- Add subscriptions High Level Abstraction. Provides access to device
  registration status notifications. Sends request to terminate long poll on
  'stop_notifications'. (#722)


1.2.6.852 (2018-03-08)
======================

Features
--------

- Support Connector Enrollment Service API in SDK. Capabilities include:
  Account Admin can upload a list of Device IDs to claim, and can view the
  status of claimed devices. Make a new device claim using:
  `mbed_cloud.EnrollmentAPI().add_enrollment_claim(enrollment_identity=YOUR_CLAIM_TOKEN)`.
  (#627)

- The HTTP header User-Agent is now configured by the SDK and contains version
  and basic platform information, which is passed to the Mbed Cloud. (#634)

Bugfixes
--------

- ConnectAPI: Add a timeout parameter to `set_resource_value` and
  `execute_resource_value` (#1015)

- Fix for list_campaign_device_states using outdated api (#1022)

- ConnectAPI: Use a different api backend for consistency when retrieving
  resource values. `set_resource_value`/`set_resource_value_async` no longer
  execute a resource (use `execute_resource` instead). (#604)

- SDKs now iterate subscriptions in order to delete them. (#733)

- Use correct API for updating campaign objects (#953)

Changes
~~~~~~~

-  Filter construction logic reworked
-  Added webhook notification handler
-  AsyncConsumer.wait()
-  Various bugfixes

.. _known-issues-1:

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Testing shows that ``get_resource_value`` will fail when the cloud
   service returns a value directly, rather than through an open
   notification channel. This affects all previous versions.
-  The only known workaround at present is to ensure the cloud cache is
   not used by:

   -  Waiting between calls to get_resource_value
   -  Reducing `the configured TTL`_ on the cloud client image on the
      device
